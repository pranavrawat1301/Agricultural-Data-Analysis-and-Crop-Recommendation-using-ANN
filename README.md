# Agricultural-Data-Analysis-and-Crop-Recommendation-using-ANN
Analyzing Agricultural Data,finding relations between features(rainfall,temperature and soil nutrients) and then processing the data cleaning and optimizing it to be feeded in an ANN for predictive modelling.
Certainly! Below is a point-wise breakdown of the key steps involved in your project:

1. **Data Analysis and Visualization of Agricultural Data:**
   - Collect agricultural data containing information on rainfall, temperature, soil nutrients, and other relevant features.
   - Use libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn to load, explore, and visualize the data.
   - Generate summary statistics, histograms, scatter plots, and other visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships between different features.

2. **Feature Extraction and Selection:**
   - Identify the relevant features (rainfall, temperature, soil nutrients) that contribute significantly to the agricultural outcomes.
   - Use statistical methods or domain knowledge to extract meaningful features from the raw data.
   - Apply techniques like correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different features.
   - Select the most important features based on their impact on agricultural outcomes.

3. **Outliers Detection:**
   - Identify and handle outliers in the dataset that might negatively impact the model's performance.
   - Use statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to detect unusual data points.
   - Decide whether to remove outliers or transform them to improve the quality of the data.

4. **Correlation Between Coefficients:**
   - Calculate correlation coefficients between pairs of features to understand the strength and direction of their relationships.
   - Visualize correlation matrices using heatmaps to identify multicollinearity or redundant information among features.
   - Use correlation analysis to guide feature selection and model building.

5. **Data Cleaning and Optimization:**
   - Handle missing values by imputing them with appropriate methods such as mean, median, or machine learning-based imputation.
   - Standardize or normalize numerical features to ensure that they are on a similar scale.
   - Encode categorical variables if present in the dataset.
   - Perform any other necessary data preprocessing steps to prepare the data for training a machine learning model.

6. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Predictive Modeling:**
   - Choose an appropriate neural network architecture based on the nature of the problem (e.g., regression or classification).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
   - Train the ANN using the cleaned and optimized data.
   - Tune hyperparameters, such as learning rate, number of hidden layers, and neurons, to optimize the model's performance.
   - Evaluate the model on the testing set to assess its predictive capabilities.

By following these steps, you can build a robust predictive model for agricultural outcomes based on the analyzed and processed data. Adjustments and refinements may be necessary based on the specific characteristics of your dataset and the goals of your predictive modeling task.
